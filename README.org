* About
*fortran-linter* is a utility program to analyze Fortran 77 legacy code. We sure
have a lot of those lying around.

Run ~make test~ from the root folder.

* Prior art
** Fortran grammar
I found an EBNF (Extended Backusâ€“Naur form) of the Fortran 77 grammar [[http://www.faqs.org/qa/qa-9372.html][here]]. So
far it seems to comply well with the official [[http://www.fortran.com/F77_std/rjcnf0001.html][standard]].

** Parser combinators
This approach of parser construction combines parsers for sub-expressions into a
parser for expressions containing them with a set of gluing operations. This
implementation takes inspirations from:
*** Parsec
The original Haskell [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec][implementation]].

*** parsec
He Tao's [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/parsec][implementation]] of Parsec.

*** pysec
Another [[http://www.valuedlessons.com/2008/02/pysec-monadic-combinatoric-parsing-in.html][approach]] with some interesting ideas.
